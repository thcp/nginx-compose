# nginx-compose
Boilerplate configuration for nginx with docker-compose

## What I did:
1) Domain purchased.
2) [Digital Ocean Droplet created](https://m.do.co/c/57b93f3b36ec) ( Get $100 in credit over 60 days )
2) Signed on [Cloudflare (free tier)](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/)
3) Followed cloudflare steps for adding a domain, changed domain's authoritative DNS servers and creating a ssl cert.
4) updated `.env` file with your domain or nginx tag.
5) executed `setup.sh` and followed the steps.
